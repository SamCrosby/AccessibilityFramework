        Currently, there are a number of organisations out there, whoâ€™s
        aim is to help women get into tech. Whether through events, workshops
        or courses, these organisations provide plenty of opportunities for women
        to learn and meet other like-minded women. Some of these organisations are
        more well known than others and so below are just a few of the organisations
        out there.

        for both women and young girls. Their events include their regular tech meetup,
        a how to start your own start-up business course, a crash course on Google Analytics,
        an iPhone apps development course and much more.

        events, talks and workshops around Manchester for women and girls who are interested
        in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Maths) subjects.
