          Female role models within the tech industry are important because
          it gives the women are trying to or are already in the tech industry,
          someone to look up to and aspire to be like. This blog brings together
          some of the most well-known women in tech role models.
          <br>
          Ada Lovelace is considered to be the world’s first computer programmer
          after she wrote the world’s first machine algorithm, intended to be
          carried out by a machine. Being the first computer programmer, she
          has become the face of the campaign to raise the profile of women
          in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Maths) subjects.
          <br>
          Katherine Johnson was an American woman who combined her talent
          with Math with computer skills as she worked at NASA and her
          calculations were proved critical to calculating the trajectory
          for Alan Sheppard, the first American in space, the success of
          the Apollo Moon landing program and the start of the Space Shuttle program.
          <br>
          Edith Clarke was the first women in America to become a professionally
          employed female electrical engineer in 1922. Before this, she performed
          difficult mathematical calculations before modern day computers and
          calculators were invented.
          <br>
          All of these women did amazing things in their time and so are the perfect
          role models for women and young girls who are in or are trying to get into the tech industry.
