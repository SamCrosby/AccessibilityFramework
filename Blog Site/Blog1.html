        Currently, only 17% of the technology workforce is made up of women.
        Even less are the number of girls studying tech related courses,
        with only 7% of students taking computer science as an A-level being
        female and only half of girls studying IT or another tech subject going
        into a job in that field. How do we get more women and girls into tech?
        Well, below are 5 ways which can help increase the number of women in tech.
        <br>
        A change of attitude: By removing the thought that only men can do these
        technology jobs, it allows girls and women to believe that they can succeed
        within this industry and increases the chances that they pursue these dreams.
        <br>
        More female role models: By having more female role models, this gives women
        someone to look up to and aspire to be like. Having these prominent women helps
        remove the stereotype that the industry is dominated by men, by showing there
        are women who have become very successful in this industry.
        <br>
        More Support: More support within the industry increases the chances of women
        staying within the tech industry, if they believe that they are supported in
        their career and progression.
        <br>
        Promoting more women into managerial roles: This goes back to the female role
        models point, where more women need to be in higher roles to show that there
        are successful women in the tech industry. More women in managerial roles
        would also show other women that there are opportunities for career progression
        within this industry.
        <br>
        More training:  Offering more training to women allows them to gain more confidence
        in their skills and allows them to continue to learn and progress within their careers.
