            In a recent survey, it was discovered that over half the respondents reason for wanting
            to get into the tech industry is because they enjoyed it at school. The next biggest
            reason was following in their parent’s footsteps, at 16.6% of respondents selecting
            this reason. The rest of reasons included a mentor/leader inspiring them, enjoying it
            as a hobby, their role evolving into a technology role and finally, always knowing they
            wanted to work with technology. So, with so many reasons for wanting to get into the tech
            industry, what causes some women to give up on their journey into the tech industry? In
            the same survey, the barriers that these women had personally witnessed included a lack
            of support, a lack of confidence in their skills, sexism, lack of female role models and
            an unequal wage. This shows that within the tech industry, there needs to be some sort
            of change that helps these women instead of making them feel like they don’t belong in
            the tech industry. These changes can include more support and training, more female
            role models and women in managerial roles and an equal wage.
